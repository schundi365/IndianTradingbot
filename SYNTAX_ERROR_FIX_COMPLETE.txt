SYNTAX ERROR FIX - COMPLETE
===================================

ISSUE RESOLVED:
- SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 794)
- File: src/mt5_trading_bot.py
- Error: "rsi_overbought', 75)" - malformed code

ROOT CAUSE:
- Lines 794 and 795 had malformed variable assignments
- Missing proper assignment operator and config.get() calls
- Likely caused by incomplete edit or copy-paste error

CHANGES MADE:
Line 794: rsi_overbought', 75)
Fixed to: rsi_overbought = self.config.get('rsi_overbought', 75)

Line 795: rsi_oversold', 25)  
Fixed to: rsi_oversold = self.config.get('rsi_oversold', 25)

VERIFICATION:
✅ Python compilation successful (no syntax errors)
✅ Import test successful
✅ Bot can now be imported and run

CONTEXT:
- This was in the RSI filter section of the trading bot
- The code gets RSI overbought/oversold thresholds from config
- Default values are 75 (overbought) and 25 (oversold) - the optimized values

STATUS: COMPLETE ✅
The bot can now run without syntax errors.
