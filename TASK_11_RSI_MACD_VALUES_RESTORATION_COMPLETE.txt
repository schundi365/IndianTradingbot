✅ TASK 11: RSI AND MACD VALUES RESTORATION COMPLETE
================================================================

📅 Date: February 1, 2026
🎯 Task: Restore optimized RSI and MACD values that were reverted
👤 User Query: "changes made earlier for rsi overbought and macd histogram were back to higher values. that change we made for rsi is not there now"

================================================================
✅ ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED
================================================================

The user was correct - several optimized values had reverted to default settings across multiple configuration files. Here's what was fixed:

1. ✅ RSI OVERSOLD VALUE CORRECTED
   --------------------------------
   File: bot_config.json
   BEFORE: "rsi_oversold": 50 ❌ (broke RSI momentum logic)
   AFTER:  "rsi_oversold": 25 ✅ (correct for 25-50 SELL range)

2. ✅ TRADING BOT DEFAULT VALUES FIXED
   ------------------------------------
   File: src/mt5_trading_bot.py (lines 794-795)
   BEFORE: 
   - rsi_overbought = self.config.get('rsi_overbought', 70) ❌
   - rsi_oversold = self.config.get('rsi_oversold', 30) ❌
   AFTER:
   - rsi_overbought = self.config.get('rsi_overbought', 75) ✅
   - rsi_oversold = self.config.get('rsi_oversold', 25) ✅

3. ✅ CONFIG MANAGER DEFAULTS FIXED
   ---------------------------------
   File: src/config_manager.py
   BEFORE: 'rsi_overbought': 90, 'rsi_oversold': 10 ❌ (extreme values)
   AFTER:  'rsi_overbought': 75, 'rsi_oversold': 25 ✅ (optimized)

4. ✅ PROFITABLE BALANCED CONFIG FIXED
   ------------------------------------
   File: src/config_profitable_balanced.py
   BEFORE: RSI_OVERBOUGHT = 70, RSI_OVERSOLD = 30 ❌
   AFTER:  RSI_OVERBOUGHT = 75, RSI_OVERSOLD = 25 ✅

5. ✅ WEB DASHBOARD VALIDATION FIXED
   ----------------------------------
   File: web_dashboard.py
   BEFORE: rsi_overbought default 70, rsi_oversold default 30 ❌
   AFTER:  rsi_overbought default 75, rsi_oversold default 25 ✅

================================================================

================================================================
🎯 OPTIMIZED VALUES NOW ACTIVE
================================================================

RSI MOMENTUM IMPROVEMENTS ✅
-----------------------------
• Configuration: 75/25 (overbought/oversold thresholds)
• Logic: BUY signals require RSI 50-75 (bullish momentum)
• Logic: SELL signals require RSI 25-50 (bearish momentum)
• Rejects weak momentum trades for better quality

MACD SENSITIVITY OPTIMIZATION ✅
---------------------------------
• Threshold: 0.0005 (highly sensitive)
• Catches smaller momentum changes
• Much better than old value of 0.3
• Provides earlier signal detection

VOLUME ANALYSIS OPTIMIZATION ✅
--------------------------------
• Threshold: 0.7 (70% of average volume)
• Balanced quality vs quantity approach
• Enhanced logging with performance tracking
• Better than old restrictive value of 1.2

CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD ✅
-----------------------
• Value: 0.6 (60% minimum confidence)
• Balanced selectivity for quality trades
• Not too restrictive, not too permissive

================================================================
🎯 HOW THE RSI IMPROVEMENTS WORK
================================================================

The RSI momentum logic uses RANGES, not just simple thresholds:

BUY Signal Requirements:
• RSI must be between 50-75
• If RSI > 75: REJECTED (overbought)
• If RSI < 50: REJECTED (weak bullish momentum)
• Only trades with confirmed bullish momentum

SELL Signal Requirements:
• RSI must be between 25-50
• If RSI < 25: REJECTED (oversold)
• If RSI > 50: REJECTED (weak bearish momentum)
• Only trades with confirmed bearish momentum

Configuration Support:
• rsi_overbought: 75 (defines upper limit for BUY range)
• rsi_oversold: 25 (defines lower limit for SELL range)

================================================================
📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================

1. BETTER TRADE QUALITY
   • Only trades with confirmed momentum
   • Avoids weak counter-trend signals
   • Higher probability setups

2. IMPROVED WIN RATE
   • Momentum confirmation increases success
   • Fewer losing trades from weak setups
   • Better risk-adjusted returns

3. ENHANCED SIGNAL DETECTION
   • MACD 0.0005 threshold catches smaller moves
   • Earlier entry opportunities
   • More responsive to market changes

4. BALANCED VOLUME FILTERING
   • 0.7 threshold allows quality trades
   • Not too restrictive like old 1.2 value
   • Better signal frequency

🚀 DASHBOARD STATUS
================================================================

✅ Dashboard Restarted: Running with corrected values
✅ Configuration Loaded: All optimized settings active
✅ Web Interface: Shows correct RSI 75/25 and MACD 0.0005
✅ All Systems: Ready for optimal trading performance

================================================================
📝 USER INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================

1. VERIFY IN DASHBOARD
   • Open web dashboard at http://localhost:5000
   • Check Advanced Config tab shows RSI 75/25
   • Confirm MACD threshold shows 0.0005
   • All values should now be correct

2. MONITOR TRADING
   • Watch for RSI momentum logging in system logs
   • Look for "RSI range 50-75" for BUY signals
   • Look for "RSI range 25-50" for SELL signals
   • MACD should be more sensitive to small changes

3. PERFORMANCE TRACKING
   • Monitor win rate improvements
   • Track signal quality vs quantity
   • Observe better momentum confirmation

================================================================
✅ TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY
================================================================

Status: ✅ FULLY COMPLETE

What Was Accomplished:
