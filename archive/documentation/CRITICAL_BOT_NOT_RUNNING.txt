🚨 CRITICAL: BOT IS NOT RUNNING - MISSED SELL SIGNAL
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
You mentioned a "big sell signal" was missed. I checked the logs and found:

❌ BOT IS NOT RUNNING
❌ NO ANALYSIS LOGS SINCE 11:23 AM
❌ ONLY DASHBOARD API REQUESTS IN LOGS

The bot is NOT analyzing any symbols. The dashboard is running, but the trading
bot itself is NOT started.

================================================================================
WHY THE SIGNAL WAS MISSED
================================================================================

The bot cannot detect signals if it's not running!

Current Log Pattern (Last 1 Hour):
```
2026-01-29 11:23:20 - INFO - GET /api/bot/status HTTP/1.1 200
2026-01-29 11:23:25 - INFO - GET /api/bot/status HTTP/1.1 200
2026-01-29 11:23:30 - INFO - GET /api/bot/status HTTP/1.1 200
[... continues with only API requests ...]
```

Expected Log Pattern (If Bot Was Running):
```
2026-01-29 11:23:00 - INFO - Starting analysis cycle for 29 symbols...
2026-01-29 11:23:00 - INFO - Analyzing XAUUSD...
2026-01-29 11:23:00 - INFO - ✓ Bearish MA crossover detected
2026-01-29 11:23:00 - INFO - SELL signal confirmed - All filters passed!
2026-01-29 11:23:00 - INFO - Opening split positions for XAUUSD...
```

================================================================================
HOW TO START THE BOT
================================================================================

Option 1: From Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Open dashboard in browser: http://localhost:5000
2. Look for "Bot Status" section
3. Click "Start Bot" button
4. Wait 60 seconds
5. Check logs - should see "Starting analysis cycle..."

Option 2: From Executable (If Dashboard Not Working)
1. Close dashboard if running
2. Run: dist\GEM_Trading_Bot_Windows\GEM_Trading_Bot_Windows.exe
3. Wait for "Bot connected successfully, starting trading loop..."
4. Bot will start analyzing

Option 3: From Python Script (Development)
1. Open terminal
2. Run: python start_dashboard.py
3. Open browser: http://localhost:5000
4. Click "Start Bot"

================================================================================
VERIFY BOT IS RUNNING
================================================================================

After starting, check logs within 60 seconds:

✓ Should See:
```
Starting analysis cycle for 29 symbols...
Analyzing XAUUSD...
No entry signal for XAUUSD (or signal detected)
Completed analysis for XAUUSD
[500ms delay]
Analyzing XAGUSD...
```

✗ If You See:
```
GET /api/bot/status HTTP/1.1 200
GET /api/analysis/performance HTTP/1.1 200
[only API requests]
```
= Bot is still not running

================================================================================
ABOUT THE MISSED SIGNAL
================================================================================

If there was a sell signal on XAUUSD (or another symbol):

1. What time did it occur?
2. Which symbol?
3. How do you know there was a signal?
   - Did you see it on MT5 chart?
   - Did another indicator show it?
   - Did you check manually?

Once you tell me:
- The exact time of the signal
- The symbol
- The timeframe

I can analyze why the bot would have missed it (if it was running).

But right now, the bot is NOT running, so it cannot detect ANY signals.

================================================================================
CURRENT BUILD STATUS
================================================================================

The build you started is still in progress. Once it completes:

1. Stop current bot (if running)
2. Replace old executable with new one
3. Start new executable
4. Verify logs show analysis

The new build includes all the fixes we discussed:
- IPC error handling
- Volume filter improvements
- Better logging
- Tick data error handling

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
================================================================================

1. START THE BOT NOW
   - Use dashboard "Start Bot" button
   - Or run executable directly

2. VERIFY IT'S RUNNING
   - Check logs for "Starting analysis cycle..."
   - Should see symbol analysis every 60 seconds

3. MONITOR FOR NEXT SIGNAL
   - Bot will detect MA crossovers
   - Will log signal detection
   - Will place trades automatically

4. WAIT FOR BUILD TO COMPLETE
   - Then replace executable
   - Restart with new version

================================================================================
WHY BOT STOPPED
================================================================================

Possible reasons:
1. You clicked "Stop Bot" in dashboard
2. Bot crashed (but no error in logs)
3. Bot was never started after opening dashboard
4. Executable was closed

Check dashboard - does it show "Bot Status: Running" or "Stopped"?

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

❌ Bot is NOT running
❌ Cannot detect signals when not running
❌ Missed signal because bot was stopped

✅ Start bot immediately
✅ Verify logs show analysis
✅ Wait for build to complete
✅ Replace with new executable

The sell signal was missed because the bot wasn't analyzing the market.
Start it now to catch the next opportunity!
