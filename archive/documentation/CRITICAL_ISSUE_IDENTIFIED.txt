CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - DETAILED LOGGING NOT WORKING
========================================================

PROBLEM CONFIRMED:
❌ The detailed logging code exists in src/mt5_trading_bot.py
❌ But when the bot runs, it's using a DIFFERENT version of the code
❌ The running bot shows basic logging instead of detailed logging
❌ File modifications are not being reflected in the running code

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. ✅ The detailed logging code IS present in src/mt5_trading_bot.py
2. ✅ The logging system works (confirmed with test_logging_directly.py)
3. ❌ The bot is importing from a different source or cached version
4. ❌ String replacements are failing due to encoding/character issues
5. ❌ The running bot shows this version:
   ```
   # DETAILED LOGGING - FORCE EXECUTION
   logging.info("="*80)
   logging.info("🔧 DETAILED INDICATOR CALCULATION STARTING")
   ```
6. ✅ But the file contains this version:
   ```
   logging.info("🚨🚨🚨 CALCULATE_INDICATORS METHOD CALLED - DETAILED LOGGING STARTING 🚨🚨🚨")
   ```

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. The bot is running from a compiled executable (dist/GEM_Trading_Bot.exe)
2. There's a Python bytecode cache issue that's not being cleared
3. The web dashboard is importing from a different path
4. There are multiple versions of the file in different locations
5. The simple_logging_fix.py overwrote the detailed logging with basic logging

EVIDENCE:
- Test shows method source contains basic logging, not detailed logging
- File inspection shows detailed logging is present
- String replacements fail due to character mismatches
- Multiple backup files exist with different versions

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Identify which version of the code is actually being executed
2. Ensure the bot is running from the Python script, not executable
3. Force complete module reload or restart all processes
4. Verify the correct version of calculate_indicators is being called

STATUS: DETAILED LOGGING IS NOT WORKING IN PRODUCTION
The user is correct - no detailed logging is appearing in the trading_bot.log file.
The bot is running with a basic logging version instead of the detailed version.
