UNLIMITED TRADES ENABLED
================================================================================
Date: 2026-01-29 17:52
Status: CONFIGURATION UPDATED

================================================================================
CHANGES MADE
================================================================================

Previous Limits:
- Max Daily Trades: 50
- Max Total Trades: 50
- Max Trades Per Symbol: 5

New Limits:
- Max Daily Trades: 999 (effectively unlimited)
- Max Total Trades: 999 (effectively unlimited)
- Max Trades Per Symbol: 10 (increased)

================================================================================
WHAT THIS MEANS
================================================================================

The bot will now:
✅ Place up to 999 trades per day (no practical limit)
✅ Hold up to 999 total open positions (no practical limit)
✅ Open up to 10 positions per symbol (increased from 5)

With 8 symbols and 10 positions each:
- Maximum possible open positions: 80 (8 symbols × 10 positions)
- This is more than enough for aggressive testing

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

Risk Management:
⚠️  With unlimited trades, the bot can place MANY trades quickly
⚠️  Each trade risks 0.5% of account balance
⚠️  Multiple losing trades can add up quickly
⚠️  Monitor your account balance and drawdown carefully

Daily Loss Limit:
✅ Still protected by max_daily_loss: 10%
✅ Bot will stop trading if daily loss reaches 10%
✅ This is your safety net

Account Protection:
✅ Adaptive risk management still active
✅ Position sizing based on account balance
✅ Stop losses on every trade
✅ Take profits at multiple levels

================================================================================
RESTART REQUIRED
================================================================================

The bot is currently running with the old limits (50 trades).
To apply the new unlimited settings:

1. Stop the bot:
   - Press Ctrl+C in terminal, OR
   - Click "Stop Bot" in dashboard

2. Start the bot:
   python start_dashboard.py

3. Verify in logs:
   - Should show new limits when bot starts
   - Will accept more trades without hitting limit

================================================================================
MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

With unlimited trades enabled, you should:

1. Watch Account Balance:
   - Check dashboard frequently
   - Monitor total P/L
   - Watch for drawdown approaching 10%

2. Monitor Open Positions:
   - Dashboard shows all open positions
   - Check how many positions are open
   - Verify they're spread across symbols

3. Check Trade Quality:
   - Are trades profitable?
   - What's the win rate?
   - Are stop losses being hit frequently?

4. Adjust If Needed:
   - If too many losing trades, tighten filters
   - If account at risk, reduce position sizes
   - If drawdown high, stop bot and review

================================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

With current aggressive configuration + unlimited trades:

Short term (15-30 minutes):
- Multiple crossovers detected across 8 symbols
- Many trades placed (10-20+)
- Dashboard shows multiple open positions
- Some positions hitting TP, some hitting SL

Medium term (1-2 hours):
- Dozens of trades placed
- Can evaluate win rate and profitability
- May hit daily loss limit if many losers
- May accumulate significant profit if many winners

Long term (full day):
- Could place 100+ trades if market is active
- Daily loss limit (10%) will stop bot if needed
- Need to monitor and adjust based on results

================================================================================
SAFETY FEATURES STILL ACTIVE
================================================================================

Even with unlimited trades, you're protected by:

✅ Max Daily Loss: 10%
   - Bot stops if daily loss reaches this
   - Protects account from catastrophic loss

✅ Stop Losses:
   - Every trade has a stop loss
   - Limits loss per trade

✅ Position Sizing:
   - Based on account balance
   - Smaller positions as balance decreases

✅ Adaptive Risk:
   - Adjusts risk based on market conditions
   - Reduces risk in ranging markets

✅ Max Drawdown: 10%
   - Additional protection layer
   - Reduces risk if drawdown increases

================================================================================
CONFIGURATION FILE
================================================================================

File: bot_config.json

Updated Settings:
{
    "max_daily_trades": 999,
    "max_trades_total": 999,
    "max_trades_per_symbol": 10,
    "max_daily_loss": 10,
    "max_drawdown_percent": 10,
    "risk_percent": 0.5,
    ...
}

All other aggressive settings remain:
- 8 symbols
- M1 timeframe
- Fast MAs (10/20)
- RSI 10/90
- MACD disabled
- Volume filter disabled
- 24/7 trading
- 25% min confidence

================================================================================
WHEN TO REDUCE LIMITS
================================================================================

Consider reducing trade limits if:

❌ Win rate is below 40%
❌ Daily loss approaching 10%
❌ Too many positions to manage
❌ Account balance decreasing rapidly
❌ Emotional stress from too many trades
❌ Can't monitor all positions effectively

To reduce limits:
1. Edit bot_config.json
2. Change max_daily_trades to lower number (e.g., 100)
3. Change max_trades_per_symbol to lower number (e.g., 5)
4. Restart bot

================================================================================
TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For testing with unlimited trades:

1. Start with small lot sizes (0.01)
   - Already configured
   - Limits risk per trade

2. Monitor for first hour
   - Check win rate
   - Check profitability
   - Adjust if needed

3. Evaluate after 20-30 trades
   - Calculate win rate
   - Calculate average profit/loss
   - Decide if settings are good

4. Adjust based on results
   - If profitable: continue or increase lot size
   - If losing: tighten filters or reduce trades
   - If mixed: fine-tune settings

================================================================================
CURRENT STATUS
================================================================================

✅ Configuration updated in bot_config.json
✅ Max daily trades: 999
✅ Max total trades: 999
✅ Max trades per symbol: 10
⚠️  Bot restart required to apply changes

Next Steps:
1. Restart bot to apply unlimited trade settings
2. Monitor closely for first hour
3. Evaluate results and adjust if needed
