### Broker Settings

```json
"broker": "kite"                    // Broker adapter (currently only Kite supported)

"default_exchange": "NSE"           // NSE (equity), NFO (futures/options)
```

### Symbol Configuration

```json

### Risk Management

```json
"risk_percent": 1.0                 // Risk per trade (% of equity)
"reward_ratio": 2.0                 // Target profit (multiple of risk)
"max_daily_loss_percent": 3.0       // Stop trading after this loss

```

**Risk Guidelines:**

"slow_ma_period": 21                // Slow moving average
"atr_period": 14                    // Average True Range period

```

**Indicator Tuning:**
- Faster MA = More signals, more noise
- Slower MA = Fewer signals, better quality

```

**Split Order Strategy:**
- First TP: Book quick profits (40-50%)
- Second TP: Let winners run (30%)
- Third TP: Capture big moves (20-30%)

### Trading Hours

```json
"trading_hours": {
  "start": "09:15",                 // Market open (IST)

}

```
