CONFIDENCE VALIDATION FIX - COMPLETE
=====================================

ISSUE RESOLVED:
- Dashboard showing "confidence should be between 20 and 90" error
- Even when confidence was set to valid values like 60%

ROOT CAUSE:
- Form was sending field name "min_confidence" 
- Backend API expects field name "min_trade_confidence"
- Field name mismatch caused validation to fail

CHANGES MADE:
File: templates/dashboard.html
Line 3543: Changed form submission field name
From: min_confidence: parseFloat(document.getElementById('min-confidence').value) / 100,
To:   min_trade_confidence: parseFloat(document.getElementById('min-confidence').value) / 100,

VALIDATION LOGIC (working correctly):
- Backend expects values between 0.2 and 0.9 (20% to 90%)
- Form displays percentages (20-90) but converts to decimals (0.2-0.9)
- Form loads: config.min_trade_confidence * 100 (0.6 → 60%)
- Form saves: form_value / 100 (60% → 0.6)

TESTING RESULTS:
✅ 20%-90% confidence values accepted
✅ Values below 20% correctly rejected  
✅ Values above 90% correctly rejected
✅ Current 60% confidence works properly
✅ Form submission successful

STATUS: COMPLETE ✅
The confidence validation error is now fixed.
