CRITICAL: REBUILD EXECUTABLE NOW - TWO MAJOR FIXES APPLIED
================================================================================

TWO CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED:

1. IPC CONNECTION ERROR FIX
   - Bot was getting "No IPC connection" errors for all symbols after first one
   - Root cause: No delay between symbol requests (rapid-fire requests)
   - Fix: Added 500ms delay between each symbol analysis
   - Impact: Bot can now analyze ALL symbols without connection errors

2. VOLUME FILTER TOO STRICT FIX
   - Bot was detecting valid signals but rejecting ALL trades
   - Root cause: Required volume to be 1.2x average (too strict)
   - Fix: Changed to "any 2 of 3 positive signals" instead of mandatory above-average
   - Impact: Bot will now place trades when signals are valid

CURRENT STATUS:
- Bot detects signals: ✓ (XAUUSD SELL, XAGUSD BUY)
- Bot analyzes all symbols: ✓ (XAUUSD, XAGUSD, GBPUSD)
- Bot places trades: ✗ (volume filter too strict)

AFTER REBUILD:
- Bot detects signals: ✓
- Bot analyzes all symbols: ✓ (with 500ms delay, no IPC errors)
- Bot places trades: ✓ (XAUUSD SELL will be accepted with 2/3 volume signals)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The config currently has only 3 symbols: XAUUSD, XAGUSD, GBPUSD
If you want to trade more symbols, add them in the dashboard configuration.

FILES MODIFIED:
1. src/mt5_trading_bot.py
   - Added time.sleep(0.5) between symbol analyses
   - Improved IPC error handling for error codes -10004 and -10001

2. src/volume_analyzer.py
   - Changed confirmation logic from "above_average AND other" to "any 2 of 3"
   - Now counts positive signals instead of requiring above_average

REBUILD COMMAND:
   build_windows.bat

TESTING AFTER REBUILD:
1. Start bot from executable
2. Check logs - should see all symbols being analyzed
3. Wait for signal detection (XAUUSD currently has SELL signals)
4. Verify trade is placed (not rejected by volume filter)
5. Monitor for IPC connection errors (should be gone)

EXPECTED FIRST TRADE:
- Symbol: XAUUSD
- Direction: SELL
- Reason: Bearish MA crossover + increasing volume + bearish OBV = 2/3 signals ✓

DOCUMENTATION:
- docs/fixes/FIX_IPC_ERROR.md
- docs/fixes/VOLUME_FILTER_TOO_STRICT_FIX.md
- SYMBOL_ANALYSIS_STATUS.txt (explains what bot is currently analyzing)
