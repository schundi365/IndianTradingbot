FINAL FIX: Bot Not Logging Analysis - Debug vs Info Logging Issue
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
- Bot starts and connects successfully
- But NO analysis logs appear
- No "Analyzing symbol", no "signal detected", nothing
- Only IPC connection errors

ROOT CAUSE:
The bot IS running and analyzing symbols, but using logging.debug() instead of
logging.info() for most analysis logs. Debug logs don't show by default.

EVIDENCE:
```python
def run_strategy(self, symbol):
    logging.debug(f"ANALYZING {symbol}")  # ← Won't show!
    logging.debug(f"Fetching historical data...")  # ← Won't show!
    logging.debug(f"No entry signal for {symbol}")  # ← Won't show!
```

FIXES APPLIED:

1. web_dashboard.py - Added cycle logging:
   ```python
   logger.info(f"Starting analysis cycle for {len(bot.symbols)} symbols...")
   logger.info(f"Analyzing {symbol}...")
   logger.info(f"Completed analysis for {symbol}")
   ```

2. src/mt5_trading_bot.py - Changed key logs to INFO:
   ```python
   logging.info(f"Analyzing {symbol}...")  # Was debug
   logging.info(f"No entry signal for {symbol}")  # Was debug
   logging.info(f"Already have X positions...")  # Was debug
   ```

WHAT YOU'LL SEE AFTER REBUILD:

Before (Silent):
```
Bot connected successfully, starting trading loop...
[nothing for 60 seconds]
WARNING - IPC connection error for XAUUSD...
[nothing for 60 seconds]
WARNING - IPC connection error for XAGUSD...
```

After (Verbose):
```
Bot connected successfully, starting trading loop...
Starting analysis cycle for 4 symbols...
Analyzing XAUUSD...
✓ Bearish MA crossover detected
  ✓ RSI filter: OK (RSI: 43.6)
  ✓ MACD filter: Confirmed (-8.7)
SELL signal confirmed - All filters passed!
SELL signal detected for XAUUSD!
Volume confirmation for sell: {...}
✓ Volume analysis passed - Confidence boost: +10%
Completed analysis for XAUUSD...
Analyzing XAGUSD...
No entry signal for XAGUSD
Completed analysis for XAGUSD...
Analyzing XPTUSD...
No entry signal for XPTUSD
Completed analysis for XPTUSD...
Analyzing GBPUSD...
No entry signal for GBPUSD
Completed analysis for GBPUSD...
[60 second wait]
Starting analysis cycle for 4 symbols...
```

FILES MODIFIED:
1. web_dashboard.py
   - Added logger.info() for cycle start
   - Added logger.info() before/after each symbol analysis
   - Added 500ms delay between symbols

2. src/mt5_trading_bot.py
   - Changed logging.debug() to logging.info() for:
     * "Analyzing {symbol}..."
     * "No entry signal for {symbol}"
     * "Already have X positions for {symbol}"

REBUILD REQUIRED: YES

================================================================================
TESTING CHECKLIST:
================================================================================

After rebuild, within 60 seconds you should see:

✓ "Starting analysis cycle for X symbols..."
✓ "Analyzing XAUUSD..."
✓ Either signal detection OR "No entry signal for XAUUSD"
✓ "Completed analysis for XAUUSD"
✓ Same for each symbol
✓ Cycle repeats every 60 seconds

If you STILL see only:
- "Bot connected successfully, starting trading loop..."
- Then silence
= The build didn't include the changes or bot loop is not running

================================================================================
WHY THIS TOOK SO LONG TO FIND:
================================================================================

1. Bot WAS working, just not logging
2. Debug logs are hidden by default
3. No errors were thrown (silent success)
4. IPC errors were red herrings (handled correctly)
5. Volume filter was disabled so that wasn't blocking
6. The bot was analyzing but we couldn't see it

The bot has been working this whole time, we just couldn't see what it was doing!
