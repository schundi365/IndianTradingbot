you need to add them in the dashboard configuration.

================================================================================
CURRENT ANALYSIS RESULTS (from logs):
================================================================================

3. GBPUSD (British Pound) - NO SIGNALS
   Status: Being analyzed every cycle
   Result: No trading signals detected yet
   Note: This is normal - not every symbol has signals at all times

================================================================================
WHY IT LOOKS LIKE ONLY XAUUSD IS CHECKED:
================================================================================

The logs show mostly XAUUSD because:
1. XAUUSD has PERSISTENT signals (detected every cycle)
2. XAGUSD only had 1 signal in the time period logged
3. GBPUSD has no signals yet

The bot IS checking all 3 symbols every 60 seconds, but only logs when:
- A signal is detected
- An error occurs
- Data fetch fails

Silent symbols (no signals) don't generate log entries.

================================================================================
AFTER REBUILD WITH FIXES:
================================================================================

Expected Behavior:
1. XAUUSD SELL signals will be ACCEPTED (2/3 volume confirmation)
2. XAGUSD weak BUY will still be REJECTED (0/3 volume confirmation)
3. GBPUSD will place trades if signals appear with 2/3 volume confirmation
4. All symbols analyzed with 500ms delay (no IPC errors)

================================================================================
