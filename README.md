## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### Volume Analysis (NEW!)

Professional-grade volume analysis integrated with adaptive risk management:

**Volume Filtering**:
- Only trades when volume > 1.2× moving average
- Filters out low-volume false breakouts
- Reduces whipsaws in ranging markets

**Volume Indicators**:
1. **Volume Trend** - Detects increasing/decreasing volume patterns
2. **On-Balance Volume (OBV)** - Momentum indicator based on volume flow
3. **Volume Divergence** - Identifies price/volume divergences
4. **Volume Profile** - Analyzes volume distribution at price levels

**Confidence Boost System**:
- Above average volume: +5%
- Increasing volume trend: +5%
- OBV confirms signal: +5%
- Bullish/Bearish divergence: +10%
- Maximum boost: +15%

Volume confidence is added to adaptive risk confidence, dynamically adjusting position size and risk parameters.

See [Volume Analysis Guide](docs/VOLUME_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md) for details.

### Adaptive Risk Management

The bot analyzes 6 market conditions in real-time:
1. Trend strength (ADX)
2. Volatility levels (ATR ratio)
3. Trend consistency
4. Price position vs MAs
5. Price momentum
6. Support/Resistance proximity

Based on this analysis, it dynamically adjusts:
- Stop loss width (1.5× to 3.0× ATR)
- Take profit targets (conservative to aggressive)
- Position size (0.3× to 1.5× multiplier)
- Trade filtering (rejects low-confidence setups)

### Split Orders

Instead of one position with one target:
```
Traditional: 0.30 lots @ TP $2160
```

The bot creates multiple positions:
```
Position 1: 0.12 lots @ TP $2145 (40% - quick profit)
Position 2: 0.09 lots @ TP $2175 (30% - moderate)
Position 3: 0.09 lots @ TP $2220 (30% - let it run)
```

Benefits:
- ✅ Lock in profits progressively
- ✅ Let winners run while protecting gains
- ✅ Higher win rate
- ✅ Better risk management

### Trailing Strategies

6 different trailing methods:
1. **ATR Trailing** - Volatility-based (default)
2. **Percentage Trailing** - Fixed percentage from price
3. **Swing High/Low** - Based on recent swing points
4. **Chandelier Exit** - Highest/Lowest point minus ATR
5. **Breakeven Plus** - Move to BE+, then trail
6. **Parabolic SAR** - Acceleration-based trailing

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- Daily loss limits
- Maximum trades per day
- Drawdown protection
