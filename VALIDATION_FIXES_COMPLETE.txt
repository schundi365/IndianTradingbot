VALIDATION FIXES - COMPLETE
============================

ISSUES RESOLVED:
1. "confidence should be between 20 and 90" error
2. "Max daily loss must be between 1% and 20% of equity" error  
3. "MACD min histogram must be between 0.0001 and 0.01" error

ROOT CAUSES:
1. Field name mismatches between form and backend
2. Type conversion errors (string/null values vs numeric comparisons)
3. Form sending wrong field names to API

CHANGES MADE:

1. FIELD NAME FIXES (templates/dashboard.html):
   - Line 3543: min_confidence → min_trade_confidence
   - Line 3544: max_daily_loss → max_daily_loss_percent

2. TYPE CONVERSION FIXES (web_dashboard.py):
   - Added try/catch blocks for numeric validations
   - Added float() conversion for all numeric fields
   - Added proper error messages for invalid types

   Fixed validations:
   - min_trade_confidence: Added float() conversion
   - max_daily_loss_percent: Added float() conversion  
   - macd_min_histogram: Added float() conversion

VALIDATION LOGIC:
- Confidence: 0.2 to 0.9 (20% to 90%)
- Max Daily Loss: 1 to 20 (1% to 20% of equity)
- MACD Min Histogram: 0.0001 to 0.01

TESTING RESULTS:
✅ All numeric validations now handle string inputs
✅ Proper error messages for invalid types
✅ Field name mismatches resolved
✅ Form submissions work correctly
✅ Edge cases properly rejected

STATUS: COMPLETE ✅
All dashboard validation errors are now fixed.
