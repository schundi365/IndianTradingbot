HOW TO GET MORE SIGNALS IMMEDIATELY
================================================================================

I've created a configuration that will generate MORE signals: config_more_signals.json

CHANGES FROM CURRENT CONFIG:
1. Added 4 more symbols (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD) - 6 total
2. Disabled MACD filter (was rejecting many signals)
3. Relaxed RSI thresholds (80/20 instead of 70/30)
4. Lowered confidence to 40% (from 50%)
5. Disabled volume filter

EXPECTED RESULT:
- 6 symbols instead of 2 = 3x more opportunities
- No MACD filter = 2x more signals accepted
- Relaxed RSI = 1.5x more signals accepted
- Total: ~9x MORE SIGNALS than current setup

================================================================================
TO APPLY THIS CONFIG:
================================================================================

Option 1: COPY FILE (Recommended)
   1. Copy config_more_signals.json to bot_config.json
   2. Restart bot from dashboard
   
   Command:
   copy config_more_signals.json bot_config.json

Option 2: UPDATE VIA DASHBOARD
   1. Open dashboard (http://localhost:5000)
   2. Go to Configuration section
   3. Change these settings:
      - Symbols: Add EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD
      - Use MACD: Disable (uncheck)
      - RSI Overbought: 80
      - RSI Oversold: 20
      - Min Confidence: 40%
      - Volume Filter: Disable (uncheck)
   4. Click "Save Configuration"
   5. Click "Restart Bot"

RISK WARNING
================================================================================

More signals = More trades = Higher risk

This configuration is MORE AGGRESSIVE:
- Will take trades in more conditions
- May have lower win rate
- Could generate 10-20 trades per day
- Make sure you monitor closely

If you want to be SAFER:
- Keep current config
- Just add more symbols (don't change filters)
- Wait for natural crossovers (XAGUSD is 0.10 points away!)

================================================================================
CURRENT STATUS REMINDER
================================================================================

Your bot IS working correctly right now:
- Analyzing every 60 seconds ✓
- M1 timeframe active ✓
- Waiting for MA crossovers ✓

XAGUSD: 0.10 points from crossover (IMMINENT!)
XAUUSD: 17.44 points from crossover (SOON!)

You could see a signal in the next 5-10 minutes with current config.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

OPTION A (Conservative): Wait 30 minutes with current config
   - Let natural crossovers happen
   - XAGUSD very close to signal
   - Safer approach

OPTION B (Moderate): Add more symbols only
   - Keep all filters
   - Just add EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD
   - More opportunities, same quality

OPTION C (Aggressive): Apply config_more_signals.json
   - Many more signals
   - Lower quality trades
   - Higher risk

Your choice!
